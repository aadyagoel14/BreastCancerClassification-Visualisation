# BreastCancerClassification-Visualisation
The Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset contains the diagnosis and 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from the centre to points on the perimeter);
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values);
- perimeter;
- area;
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths);
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0);
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour);
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour);
- symmetry;
- fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1).<br>


The mean, standard error (SE) and “worst” or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. <br>

We will analyze the features to understand the predictive value for diagnosis. We will then create models using two different algorithms and use the models to predict the diagnosis.
